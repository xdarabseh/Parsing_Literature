d04d7db8-edf0-4f58-85e6-394a32d16937,Automation in digital analysis solutions for nuclear design-construction integration using BIM-FEM interoperability,"Design changes during the construction phase of nuclear power plants can lead to significant financial expenses and delays in the project schedule, largely due to the complex regulatory and safety requirements specific to nuclear facilities. Effective communication and management of these changes with all involved parties to assess the associated risks effectively can potentially prevent cost overruns and delays. Enhancing the interoperability between building information modeling (BIM) and finite element (FE) analysis software can mitigate the impacts of redesign through efficient communication between design and construction teams. This improvement involves creating an FE model for structural elements or mechanical piping systems based on BIM's building data. Accurate identification of the geometric location and section properties of BIM elements is essential for precise FE model development. Hence, this study provides an overview of an interoperability interface program between BIM and FEM, facilitating the seamless integration of efforts by design and construction engineers to ensure alignment across different project components. The extracted structural properties are utilized to generate accurate geometric and structural FE models in ANSYS Mechanical APDL. Prior to approving design changes due to construction constraints, a thorough structural analysis must be conducted. This research explores automated structural analysis of nuclear systems using an updated FEM model, emphasizing standardized interfaces for software communication. Improved interoperability and automated FE analysis not only enhance the flow of critical information between design and construction engineers but also provide a basis for risk-informed construction management, enhancing both safety and efficiency in nuclear power plant construction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,2026,10.1016/j.ijpvp.2025.105661,2-s2.0-105016777576,9466db07-64d8-4e19-b6ed-d62e1e6188ba

Yet, the industry leaders using it and related researchers do not specify much of the requirements involved with 4D simulation constructability collaboration review. This article provides a conceptual framework of such 4D collaboration reviews including the perimeter of required related activities, key characteristics, and metrics involved with 4D simulation generation. It provides experienced benefits associated with 4D simulation constructability collaboration review including delay claims avoidance elements. Involved stakeholders mentioned the 4D simulation as a proactive method useful for cross-examination and detection in relation to sequence changes, scope changes, design changes, and additional useful project details. 4D simulation reduces blind spots generated with classic project schedule reviews including changes, causation, and impacts, which are useful aspects for the lawyers. This article shows two projects with 4D simulation deliverables and reports that experienced earlier constructability validation, scenarios with less conflicts, reduced number of changes and reworks on site, became less risky and encouraged completion with respect of the as-planned construction schedule. The resulting implication are 4D simulation and collaboration reviews to reduce delays and claims, including false claims, and as dissuasion tools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,2026,10.1061/JLADAH.LADR-1335,2-s2.0-105016662598,d147239b-b432-4472-8702-632abf534746
1f8828d3-3949-4d1b-a117-d471f531419a,Toward the Definition of Best Practices in Collaboration for Digital Transformation in Construction,"This paper aims to clarify the real meaning and relevance of collaboration for digital transformation in the construction industry. An exploratory approach, using a qualitative study through open-ended in-depth (n=13) semistructured interviews was chosen. The question ""What does collaboration look like in the real world of digitalized construction projects""was posed to architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry experts representing middle- and senior-level management from large construction projects. Content analysis of the existing literature, standards, nation-specific guidelines, and documents pertaining to collaboration, and thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews was analyzed using NVivo to form concept maps. The findings for the definition of collaboration included multiple parties' involvement and workflows in place. From the collaborative behaviors and practices within the alliance work and integrated process, two key themes emerged, i.e., self-managing teams and open-mindedness toward problem resolution. Additionally, the association of an appropriate procurement strategy involved relationship within the collaboration phenomenon. On the role of technology in collaboration, collectively all the experts confirmed that building information modeling (BIM) and email communications, cloud environment and Microsoft Teams facilitated smooth collaborative workflows. The findings from the thematic data analysis in the form of project and concept maps reveal the key emergent themes that necessitate collaboration and interdependencies toward the best practice for digital transformation in the construction industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,2026,10.1061/JLADAH.LADR-1247,2-s2.0-105016368255,d147239b-b432-4472-8702-632abf534746
1036cc0f-3e7b-4eea-bda7-d889157b3ebe,Multi-view sonar image generation via GAN trained with limited data for underwater object classification and detection,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a promising approach to address the data scarcity issue in intelligent underwater object recognition. However, existing advanced GANs still suffer from the challenge of discriminator overfitting when constrained by limited sonar data. To address this challenge, this work proposes a Dual Augmentation method for GANs (DA-GAN) to stabilize training under limited data, thereby synthesizing high-fidelity and multi-view sonar images. DA-GAN incorporates two core modules: Adaptive Adversarial Example Augmentation (AAEA) and Random Differentiable Augmentation (RDA). The AAEA module generates adversarial examples by applying imperceptible perturbations to generated sonar images using Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Projected Gradient Descent attack (PGD), effectively deceiving the discriminator. Adversarial examples strategically replace real samples according to the degree of discriminator overfitting. Concurrently, the RDA module applies random differentiable augmentations to both real and fake sonar samples, further mitigating the overfitting. Furthermore, leveraging the local smoothness of the latent space, we design three methods—nonlinear perturbation, sparse sign perturbation, and style-mixing to perturb the latent codes, generating multi-view sonar images. Experiment results demonstrate that DA-GAN effectively mitigates discriminator overfitting, generating sonar images with superior quality compared to StyleGAN2 on the SCTD dataset, with the FID improvement from 175.341 to 87.187. On the KLSG dataset, DA-GAN achieves an FID score of 58.067. Furthermore, after augmenting the SCTD dataset, the classification model (e.g., ResNet-34) achieves a 12.50 % improvement in global accuracy, while the detection model (e.g., YOLOv5s) shows a 6.9 % increase in mAP0.5:0.95. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,2026,10.1016/j.eswa.2025.129452,2-s2.0-105014633792,51c14ee2-b41a-42ee-a426-a3d99aca940a
8b3cd2ba-ff4d-43aa-9e81-c544b72b8834,A WebGIS-based digital twin platform for intelligent operation and maintenance of rail transit infrastructure,"The digital twin, which integrates multidisciplinary attributes to achieve interactions between the virtual and the real worlds, has found numerous applications in the field of smart cities and transportation infrastructure. With the acceleration of urbanization, rail transit, as a key component of urban infrastructure, faces increasing challenges in maintenance and management. Traditional reactive maintenance methods can no longer meet the growing volume of user demands. This study presents an architecture of intelligent operation and maintenance platform for the rail transit infrastructure based on WebGIS, paving the way for a digital-twin solution driven by predictive maintenance. We present a case study of the Shanghai Metro Long Yang Road-Zhang Jiang High Tech experimental line, which demonstrates the significant advantages of our platform in real-time data integration, 3D visualization, and intelligent decision support. Dynamic simulation integrating finite element and multibody dynamics software further validate the effectiveness of digital twin technology in the identification and prediction of rail fastener damage. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,2026,10.1016/j.eswa.2025.129180,2-s2.0-105012866885,51c14ee2-b41a-42ee-a426-a3d99aca940a

However, there remains a lack of clarity over how varying BIM levels of development (LODs) align to the DTs digital model developed from BIM models, especially from a data maturity and DT application perspective. This research presents a pioneering effort to align the BIM LODs to the different classes of DTs. The dimensionality of BIM data, i.e., the evolving number of model features and attributes as the model progresses, is mapped onto the different classes of DTs, leading to the definition of a novel taxonomy for classifying BIM-based DTs. The ensuing taxonomy, validated by stakeholders in industry and academia, helps clarify the utility of as-designed and as-built models in the implementation of BIM-based DTs in the AECO industry. Ultimately, the research clarifies how LOD 500 relates to BIM-based DTs for facilities management (FM) from an element modeling perspective. This research provides a theoretical foundation for future DT researchers on how to classify their BIM-based DTs for FM and practical guidance for owners on what the LOD requirements are for different types of DTs for FM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,2026,10.1061/JCCEE5.CPENG-6479,2-s2.0-105016971161,528d3adf-19ba-42fc-a66f-9eca06fb408e
559aefc4-7847-440e-be51-13e2a2fad6e0,BIMFusion: Texturing Building Information Models Using Diffusion Generative Methods,"Models created by building information modeling (BIM) represent scenes with rich semantics but are usually untextured. The absence of authentic textures impedes BIM-related tasks and BIM's downstream applications such as interior design. This paper aims to style a BIM indoor scene with the help of diffusion models, a family of generative algorithms capable of synthesizing high-quality images. The proposed pipeline BIMFusion classifies elements in an indoor scene into structural and furniture elements. Texturing structural elements is achieved by first synthesizing tileable texture candidates and then selecting the optimal candidates with an automatic rating method. For furniture elements, this paper develops a geometry-aware method to texture furniture within a scene, based on a multiview 3D texture algorithm but adapted to better fit the characteristics of BIM models. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the generated textures are visually satisfactory, strictly aligned with the model's geometry and semantics, and comply with the user's intended styles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,2026,10.1061/JCCEE5.CPENG-6330,2-s2.0-105016555813,528d3adf-19ba-42fc-a66f-9eca06fb408e
6bc95329-2778-4f99-a527-72c7fdca9b4c,A Large language model-based multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloors,"As customer demand for multi-variety and small-batch production increases, dynamic disturbances place greater demands on manufacturing systems. To address such challenges, researchers proposed the multi-agent manufacturing system. However, conventional agent negotiation typically relies on pre-defined and fixed heuristic rules, which are ill-suited to managing complex and fluctuating disturbances. In current implementations, mainstream approaches based on reinforcement learning require the development of simulators and training models specific to a given shopfloor, necessitating substantial computational resources and lacking scalability. To overcome this limitation, the present study proposes a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor management. By defining the diverse modules of agents and their collaborative methods, this system facilitates the processing of all workpieces with minimal human intervention. The agents in this system consist of the Machine Server Module (MSM), Bid Inviter Module (BIM), Bidder Module (BM), Thinking Module (TM), and Decision Module (DM). By harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, these modules enable agents to dynamically analyze shopfloor information and select appropriate processing machines. The LLM-based modules, predefined by system prompts, provide dynamic functionality for the system without the need for pre-training. Extensive experiments were conducted in physical shopfloor settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits strong adaptability, and achieves superior performance (makespan) and stability (as measured by sample standard deviation) compared to other approaches without requiring pre-training. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,2026,10.1016/j.aei.2025.103888,2-s2.0-105016305918,f6aa916c-e002-404e-835f-94b52d194ffb
52efea6b-9149-478d-9c5e-6bd6470e407e,Meta-Metamodel-Independent Model Transformations,"Model-driven engineering efficiently manages complexity through high-level abstractions and model transformations, progressively refining models into executable code. However, current approaches require models to adhere to the same meta-metamodel, limiting their applicability to isolated ecosystems like Eclipse/Ecore or UML. The adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has highlighted the need for transforming models across various life cycle phases. Yet, the fractured modeling landscape of BIM poses challenges as of existing solutions’ restriction on complying to the same meta-metamodel and supported modeling formalisms (e.g., Eclipse/Ecore or UML). We introduce a novel meta-metamodel-independent model transformation formalism, accompanied by a domain-specific modeling language for declaring transformation rules at the meta-model level. Our approach leverages a formalism-independent core language for on-the-fly establishment of meta-models, enabling meta-metamodel-independent model transformations. We validate our proposal through case studies in construction and software engineering, demonstrating its feasibility and generalizability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Conference paper,2026,10.1007/978-3-032-04190-6_20,2-s2.0-105016221011,dd383105-1046-4784-9d03-f9f8242dcc45
