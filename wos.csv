However, the impacts of BIM deployment on construction contracts and dispute resolution remain unclear. This research analyzed the regulatory and legal implications of BIM adoption in construction industry via a framework evaluating Contractual Frameworks (CF), Dispute Resolution (DR), Legal Awareness (LA), and Risk Management (RM). Fifteen qualitative interviews with construction industry experts provided key insights. The results showed CF, DR, and LA have a large positive impact on BIM adoption, while RM has a smaller effect. Specifically, clearly defined BIM protocols in contracts, efficient dispute resolution mechanisms, and legal knowledge of BIM are essential to ensure effective deployment. These findings imply construction project managers should proactively address contractual and legal factors to manage risks, encourage collaboration, and adhere to regulations when implementing BIM. This research makes a significant contribution by addressing the lack of empirical insights on the contractual and legal aspects of BIM adoption. The qualitative methodology provides in-depth perspectives from experienced industry practitioners. The findings offer valuable insights for stakeholders worldwide seeking to leverage BIM.

Feature engineering techniques are utilized to generate dynamic BIM features, compensating for the lack of sensory and contextual data in Building Management Systems (BMS). By integrating AFDD analytics with BIM, a comprehensive digital twin of the facility is created, which enables facility managers to compare, reuse, and develop AFDD models for HVAC systems.

This paper conducts a comprehensive scoping review that utilises secondary data to systematically map the existing literature on the adoption of BIM within AECO organisations. A literature review identified 146 papers on BIM in AECO organisations, categorising them into 46 on pre-adoption, 85 on post-adoption, and 15 on both phases. Findings reveal a tendency towards a 'tunnel vision', isolating a single organisational aspect or adoption phase. However, the study finds that BIM significantly interacts with various organisational elements, such as environment, power dynamics, social structure, and culture, necessitating comprehensive changes and strategies both before and after adoption. Advocating for a holistic approach, the study emphasises integrating change management, continuous learning, and ongoing improvement in BIM implementation. This perspective is a significant contribution to understanding BIM's multifaceted impact in AECO organisations.","[Chowdhury, Mahmuda; Martek, Igor; Shuchi, Sarah] Deakin Univ, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia; [Hosseini, M.

However, the current adoption of DT in bridge engineering causes conceptual and technical confusion, which hinders the technology fusion to achieve its full potential. This paper aims at filling the gap by conceptualizing a DT-enhanced BIM framework from the perspective of bridge engineering. In total, 125 116 documents on BIM and DT were reviewed, compared, and analyzed; a crucial metrics based performance hierarchy for bridge digital twin was concluded and a DT -enhanced BIM framework was proposed to promote full lifecycle digital bridge engineering implementation. Furthermore, the analysis and conceptual development align well with the existing mature BIM framework and are expected to contribute actively to the future development of BIM and DT and their integrated advanced technologies.","[Song, Honghong; Yang, Gang; Zhang, Tian; Jiang, Annan] Dalian Maritime Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China; [Li, Haijiang] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Engn, Cardiff CF24 3AA, Wales",Dalian Maritime University; Cardiff University,"Zhang, T (corresponding author), Dalian Maritime Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China.;Li, HJ (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Engn, Cardiff CF24 3AA, Wales.",lih@cardiff.ac.uk; saghb@126.com,"Jiang, An~nan!/AAT-4417-2021; LI, HAIJIANG/JJF-9281-2023; Yang, Gang/B-2616-2008","Song, Honghong/0009-0000-3136-2598;","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [3132019349]; China Scholarship Council [CSC 202106570014]; BIM for Smart Engineering Centre in Cardiff University, UK","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); BIM for Smart Engineering Centre in Cardiff University, UK","This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China, Grant 3132019349, the China Scholarship Council under Grant CSC 202106570014, and BIM for Smart Engineering Centre in Cardiff University, UK.

However, previous studies have focused on a particular facet of project management (e.g., safety, quality, facility management) and within identified target journals. Despite numerous existing studies, there is limited research on the mainstream research topics, gaps and future research directions on BIM in project management. This study aims to conduct a bibliometric and science mapping review of published articles on BIM in project management and to identify mainstream research topics, research gaps and future research directions in this domain. Design/methodology/approach - A science mapping approach consisting of bibliometric search, scientometric analysis and qualitative discussion was used to analyze 521 journal articles that were retrieved from the Scopus database and related to BIM in project management. In the scientometric analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis and document analysis were performed. This was followed by a qualitative discussion that seeks to propose a framework summarizing the interconnection between the mainstream research topics, research gaps and future research directions. Findings - Six mainstream research topics were found including (1) BIM-enabled advanced digital technologies, (2) BIM-based reinforcement and enhancement, (3) BIM and project composition, (4) BIM project elements and attributes, (5) BIM-based collaboration and communication and (6) BIM-based information and data. Moreover, this study discussed six research gaps, namely, (1) integration of BIM and other digital technologies, (2) future maturity of BIM applications in project management, (3) application of BIM in project components and processes, (4) role of BIM application in project elements and attributes, (5) impact of collaboration and communication in BIM application and (6) stability of information and data interaction. Furthermore, future research directions were discussed. Originality/value - The findings and proposed framework contribute to providing a deeper understanding to researchers, policymakers and practitioners in the development of related research and practice in the domain of BIM in project management, thus, promoting digital transformation in project management. Overall, it adds to the global knowledge domain in BIM and promotes the need for digital and data integration, BIM maturity and BIM collaboration.","[Ye, Zhaofeng] Univ Manchester, Dept Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour] Aston Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Tezel, Algan] Univ Nottingham, Dept Civil Engn, Nottingham, England; [Manu, Patrick] Univ West England, Sch Architecture & Environm, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Manchester; Aston University; University of Nottingham; University of West England,"Antwi-Afari, MF (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",m.antwiafari@aston.ac.uk,"Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour/ACH-3297-2022; Manu, Patrick/N-9004-2013","Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour/0000-0002-6812-7839;","Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering, University of Manchester, UK","Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering, University of Manchester, UK","The authors are grateful to the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering, University of Manchester, UK for supporting this research.

This paper establishes a generalizable structural framework that can potentially facilitate BIM maturity analysis in a portfolio of projects or the industry as a whole and will generate fresh insight into designing quantitative BIM maturity models across various contexts.","[Chen, Zhen-Song; Zhou, Meng-Die] Wuhan Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Chin, Kwai-Sang] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Adv Design & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chin, Kwai-Sang] City Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Darko, Amos] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hung Hom, 11 Yuk Choi Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xian-Jia] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Pedrycz, Witold] Univ Alberta, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada; [Pedrycz, Witold] Polish Acad Sci, Syst Res Inst, PL-00901 Warsaw, Poland; [Pedrycz, Witold] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Pedrycz, Witold] Istinye Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Dept Comp Engn, Sariyer Istanbul, Turkiye","Wuhan University; City University of Hong Kong; Shenzhen Research Institute, City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Wuhan University; University of Alberta; Polish Academy of Sciences; Systems Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences; King Abdulaziz University; Istinye University","Chen, ZS (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",zschen@whu.edu.cn,"Zhou, Mengdie/LWH-5645-2024; DARKO, AMOS/C-4721-2018; Pedrycz, Witold/HJZ-2779-2023; Chen, Zhen-Song/K-3436-2019","Chen, Zhen-Song/0000-0003-4360-5459","National Natural Science Foundation of China [72171182, 71801175, 71871171, 71971182, 72031009]; Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences [20ZD058]; Theme-based Research Projects of the Research Grants Council [T32-101/15-R]; City University of Hong Kong SRG [7004969]; Ger/HKJRS project [G-CityU103/17]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences; Theme-based Research Projects of the Research Grants Council; City University of Hong Kong SRG(City University of Hong Kong); Ger/HKJRS project,"Acknowledgments This work was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 72171182, 71801175, 71871171, 71971182, and 72031009) , the Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences (Grant no. 20&ZD058) , the Theme-based Research Projects of the Research Grants Council (Grant no.
